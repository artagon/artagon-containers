# act configuration for local GitHub Actions testing
# See: https://github.com/nektos/act

# Use catthehacker's Ubuntu image which closely matches GitHub-hosted runners
-P ubuntu-latest=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest

# Default container architecture for standalone act usage.
# Note: 'make test-ci' overrides this with OS detection:
#   - Apple Silicon (arm64): uses linux/arm64 for native performance
#   - Intel Mac / Linux: uses linux/amd64
# Direct 'act' invocations without make will use this default.
--container-architecture linux/amd64
# Note: act is configured to run with linux/amd64 only. Our CI builds images for both
# linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, so local act runs will not catch arm64-specific issues.
