# GITHUB_TOKEN is used by act when running workflows that require GitHub API access.
# This token is optional for many workflows - only needed when accessing GitHub API.
#
# To generate a token:
#   1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
#   2. Create a Personal Access Token (classic) with "repo" scope
#   3. Paste the token value below
#
# Alternative: use 'gh auth token' to get a token from GitHub CLI (requires 'gh auth login')
# The make test-ci target does this automatically.

GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
